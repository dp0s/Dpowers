Installation and Dependencies
*****************************

Install from PyPI::

    pip install Dpowers

(This will automatically install the package 'Dhelpers' as a
necessary pydependency. All of Dhelpers' functions and classes can be used
independently, i.e. without the Dpowers package installed.)

.. note:: The pip install command does NOT install any of the backend
    dependencies, which are required to use the Dpowers.
